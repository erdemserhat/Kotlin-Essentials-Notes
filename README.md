# Kotlin-Essentials-Notes

Welcome to the **Kotlin-Essentials-Notes** repository! This project provides a detailed implementation of the **Head First Kotlin: A Brain-Friendly Guide** book. I have used this book as a guide to learn Kotlin, and this repository reflects my journey through each chapter with practical examples and notes.
